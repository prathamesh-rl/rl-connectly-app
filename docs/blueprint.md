## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673ab7) for the main navigation and interactive elements.
- Accent color: Orange (#ff9800) for the add button and other important actions.
- Background color: Light gray (#f5f5f5) for table rows and content areas to provide visual separation.
- Text color: Dark gray (#333) for headings and body text to ensure readability.
- Body and headline font: 'Roboto', a sans-serif font, to be used throughout the application. It provides a clean and modern look.
- Font sizes: Use a consistent scale for headings (20-24px), labels (12-14px), and body text (14-16px).
- Use simple, line-style icons from a library like Material Icons for navigation and actions.
- Use a fixed left sidebar for navigation, with a main content area on the right. Employ a grid layout for responsive design.
- Cards: Use white cards with subtle shadows for content sections to create depth and separation.
- Incorporate subtle animations (e.g., hover effects, transitions) to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
